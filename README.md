daily_coding_problem

A collection of solved coding problems from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).
I wanted to improve my javascript skills and thought solving small-scale coding problems would be the best approach for me.

Currently using:
- JavaScript as the main programming language
- Jest for testing
- NPM / Node.js for managing module dependencies
